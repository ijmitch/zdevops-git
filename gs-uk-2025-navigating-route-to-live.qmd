# Session Description

In this session Ian and Dennis will recap the recommended branching scheme and CI/CD pipeline support for IBM Z Devops 
and explore how that scheme compares with legacy approaches to promoting, testing and deploying
code on a route from developer to production.

The focus is on aligning to recognised industry practices while not losing the essential 
safeguards maintaining your production system's reputation for stability and security.

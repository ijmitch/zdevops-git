## Setting the context

- Devops is foundational to modernization.

- Modernization of Devops is no longer a voyage of exploration.

  - (But plenty people will still try to convince you otherwise!)

- No single tool or approach covers the entire journey to the destination.

We have a [Guide](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/ibm-z-devops-solution)... yes, it would be better if it were a map!

## The Guide

# Aims and Assumptions

Some aims and assumptions that guide our recommendations...

## No baggage

Well... *[travel light](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/mathieu-dalbin/2023/11/22/a-no-baggage-approach-to-new-mainframe-development?communityKey=b68f8006-7e86-4043-843f-df16dc7065f9)* perhaps!

- Are we *prescriptive* or just *opinionated*?
  - Aim to be *git-native*!
- We start with a recommendation
  - Confidently
- We question everything 
  - **YAGNI** - "you aren't gonna need it"
- We strive for simplicity
  - For each user's experience

## Scaling

- The workflow and branching scheme should both scale up and scale down.
  - Small teams with simple and infrequent changes will be able to easily understand, adopt, and have a good experience.
  - Large, busy teams with many concurrent activities will be able to plan, track, and execute with maximum agility using the same fundamental principles.

## Planning {.smaller}

- Planning and design activities as well as code development aim to align to a regular release cadence.

- The cadence of the next planned release is defined by the application team.

- Planning assumptions should aim as much as possible to complete changes quickly, ideally within one release cycle.

  - DevOps/Agile practices to break down larger changes into sets of **smaller, incremental** deliverables that can each be completed within an iteration. 
<!--
  - This reduces the number of "in-flight" changes, and allows the team to deliver **value** more quickly while still building towards a larger development goal.

  - We know it is sometimes unavoidable for work to take longer than one release cycle and we accommodate that as a variant of the base workflow.

# The Branching Strategy

## Starting Simple {.smaller}

Every change starts in a branch.

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch feature/001
  commit
```

- Developers work in the branch to make changes, perform user builds and unit tests.

- A branch holds multiple commits (changes to multiple files).

## Starting Simple {.smaller}

Every change starts in a branch.

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch feature/001
  commit
  commit
```

These changes on these branches are 

- built,
- tested, 
- reviewed and 
- approved before merging to `main`.

## Preparing to Merge into `main` {.smaller}

Feature Team/Developers will:

- Build
  - Builds may be done to any commit on any branch
  - Feature branch **must** build cleanly for a Pull Request
- Test
  - To prove quality of the changes in their feature branch

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch feature/001
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/001
```

## Merging into `main` {.smaller}

Create a Pull Request (PR) to signal to Team Leaders/Release Controllers to:

- Review
  - Code and Test results
- Approve
  - Safeguard the quality of `main`

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch feature/001
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/001
```

`main` and other long-lived branches are *protected* (not everyone can `push` or `merge` to them).

## Before you ask... no, there is no *Production* branch {.smaller}

CI/CD decouples the building and deploying to test environments and production.

We have no branches named `prod` (or `test` or `QA`)

- Those are *environments* to which builds can be deployed
- Such extra branches:
  - are unnecessary
  - cause ambiguity
  - impose merging and building overheads

- Deployment manager is maintaining what is deployed where and provides traceability from developer to production deployment

## Testing a release candidate {.smaller}

Any point in the history of `main` can be declared a *release candidate*.

- Build a *release candidate* package
- Deploy it
- Test it

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    mainBranchOrder: 2
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch feature/001 order: 3
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/001
  commit tag: "RC1"
  branch maintenance/release1.1
  commit tag: "Build, deploy, test"
```

Tag the commit (point in `main`'s history) with a release name.

## Deploying to production {.smaller}

When all the committed work items for the next planned release are ready to be shipped, and all quality gates have passed successfully and the required approvals have been issued by the appropriate reviewers, the release package and be deployed to production.

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    mainBranchOrder: 4
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit
  branch feature/001 order: 4
  commit
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/001
  commit tag: "RC1"
  branch maintenance/release2.2-RC1 order: 3
  commit tag: "Build, deploy, test"
  checkout main
  branch feature/002 order: 4
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/002
  commit tag: "RC2"
  branch maintenance/release2.2.0-RC2 order: 2
  commit tag: "Build, deploy, test"
  checkout main
  commit tag: "Rel2.2"
  branch maintenance/release2.2.0 order: 1
  commit tag: "Build, deploy, test, release"
```

## Release maintenance branches {.smaller}

A *release maintenance* branch will be used if *hot-fixes* must be developed and delivered.

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    mainBranchOrder: 2
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  commit tag: "rel2.1.0"
  branch maintenance/rel2.1.x order: 1
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  branch feature/001 order: 2
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  branch feature/002 order: 1
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/001
  checkout maintenance/rel2.1.x
  branch hotfix/001 order: 0
  commit
  checkout maintenance/rel2.1.x
  merge hotfix/001
  commit tag: "rel2.1.1"
  checkout main
  merge feature/002


```

## Scaling up {.smaller}

Concurrent *feature* branches scale very well, but assume short cycle times.

- Ideally live within a release delivery cycle
- But no big deal if they don't

*Epic* branches can collect multiple features

- Before going to `main`
- When the delivery is planned beyond the next release

(*Epic* branches are a form of *integration* branch.)

## Integration branches {.smaller}

```{mermaid}
---
config:
  fontFamily: "IBM Plex Sans"
  gitGraph:
    mainBranchOrder: 2
    showCommitLabel: false
---
gitGraph
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  branch epic/proj001/001 order: 3
  commit
  branch feature/proj001/004 order: 4
  commit
  checkout epic/proj001/001
  branch feature/proj001/005 order: 5
  commit
  checkout feature/proj001/004
  commit
  checkout main
  commit
  branch feature/001 order: 2
  commit
  checkout main
  branch feature/002 order: 1
  commit
  checkout epic/proj001/001
  merge feature/proj001/004
  checkout main
  merge feature/001
  checkout epic/proj001/001
  merge feature/proj001/005
  checkout feature/002
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/002
  branch feature/003 order: 2
  commit
  checkout main
  merge feature/003
  commit tag: "rel2.2.0"
  checkout epic/proj001/001
  commit tag: "continue-epic"
```

## Convention over configuration {.smaller}

The principles are more important that the tools and names.

Naming conventions - making purpose obvious:

- `main` : single source of truth. The only long-living branch.
- `release/rel-2.0.1` : explicit versioning numbering to identify releases maintenance branch.
- `epic/47-ai-fraud-detection` : development initiative identified by epic id and description.

## Convention over configuration {.smaller}

Changes are implemented on feature branches:

- `feature/<jira-id|servicenow-id>-new-mortgage-calculation` : references to other planning tools for new features for the next planned release.
- `feature/47-ai-fraud-detection/refactor-mortgage-calculation`: feature implemented for development initiative 
- `hotfix/rel-2.0.1/fix-mortgage-calc`: fix implemented for release rel-2.0.1 

Names of branches and tags flow through to builds and deployments.

# Workflows supported by the strategy 

How do teams work with and benefit from the branch strategy?

## The types of workflows {.smaller}

1) Work and focus on the **next planned release** via the `main` branch. After planning the work items for the next release, the development team is adding changes to the main branch.


2) **Resolution of a production problem** in the currently-released version of the application by leveraging a release maintenance branch that is used for maintenance purposes,
   
3) **concurrent development activities for significant development initiatives**, which include multiple planned work items for a later delivery (including starting development of a future release) by creating an epic branch from a commit point in the history of main.

*The following narratives complement the structure.*

## Features for the next planned release

**Developer activities:**

::: {.incremental}

1. Take item from backlog
2. Create feature branch
3. Code locally
4. Build with DBB User Build
5. Commit into feature branch, build and test feature functionality
6. Create Pull Request for review and approval

:::

## Features for the next planned release

**Release control activities:**

::: {.incremental}

7. Merge approved branches to `main` and build
8. When planned features have merged, build and tag Release Candidate package
9.  Deploy Release Candidate to test environments
10. (*Release candidate can be superceded*)
11. Finalise Release package in Artifactory (or equivalent)
12. Tag commit from step 8 as the production release and deploy

## Addressing pain points {.smaller}

* Different pipelines orchestrators are used by customers
* Existing tasks (build, package, deployment) are too flexible and have too many config options
* Pipeline implementation puts the workflow model "into code"

<!-- # Appendix - Workflow walkthrough {.smaller}

## Fix a production defect  {.smaller}

* The process of urgent fixes for modules in the production environment follows the fix-forward approach, rather than rolling back the affected modules and reverting to the previous deployed state.

* The development team starts this process by creating a **release maintenance** branch of the git tag that represents the most recent release, that was deployed to production. 

![](static/img/branching-model/releaseMaintenanceWorkflow_overview.png)

## Fix a production defect  {.smaller}

**Developer activities resolving a production defect:**

::: {.incremental}

1. Creates the `release/rel-2.1.0` branch based on the existing Git tag
2. Creates a feature branch `hotfix/rel-2.1.0/urgent-fix` from the release maintenance branch.
3. Implement the fix locally
4. Build with DBB User Build
5. Commit into hotfix branch, push, build and test feature functionality 
6. Create Pull Request for review and approval

:::

## Fix a production defect {.smaller}

**Release control activities resolving a production defect:**

::: {.incremental}

7. Merge hotfix branch to release maintenance branch and build
8. Use release pipeline to create fix package
9. Deploy fix package to controlled test environments and test it
10. Deploy fix package to production
11. Tag commit from step 8 indicating the new version
12. Merge release maintenance branch into `main`.

:::

<!-- ## Building the fix package {.smaller}
* Changes contributed to the release maintenance branch are build and packaged.
* The fix package is tested in the appropriate test environment(s)
* Finally deployed to production

![](static/img/branching-model/releaseMaintenanceWorkflow_fixPackageBuild.png)

* The commit is tagged as the new version `2.1.1`.

## Using the Epic branch workflow {.smaller}

Dealing with significant development initiatives such as:

* Updates in regulatory frameworks
* Start the development phase of *subsequent* releases

&rarr; A process to work independently from the base workflow.

## Using the Epic branch workflow {.smaller}

**Developer activities for implementing significant development initiatives:**

::: {.incremental}

1. Creates the `epic/ai-fraud-detection` branch based on the existing Git tag
2. Creates a feature branch `feature/ai-fraud-detection/introduce-ai-model-to-mortgage-calculation` from the epic branch.
3. Code locally
4. Build with DBB User Build
5. Commit into feature branch, push, build and test feature functionality 
6. Create Pull Request for review and approval to merge into the integration branch

:::

## Using the Epic branch workflow {.smaller}

**Release activities for implementing significant development initiatives:**

::: {.incremental}

7. Merge feature branch to epic branch and build
8. Use release pipeline to create preliminary package
9. Deploy package to project test environment
10. Frequently synchronize with `main` into the epic branch to avoid making the merge of the `epic` branch into `main` difficult.
11. Decision **when** the changes on the epic branch should be released
12. Merge epic branch into `main` and deliver via the base workflow.

:::

## Epic branch workflow {.smaller}

![](static/img/branching-model/image12.png)

## Guidelines and policies in the epic branch workflow

* Frequently synchronize with `main` into the epic branch to avoid making the merge of the `epic` branch into `main` difficult.

* Preliminary packages must not be deployed to a production runtime.

# Appendix - Pipeline implementations {.smaller}

## Pipeline implementation conventions & principles  {.smaller}

::: {layout-ncol=2}

* Git tags are used to calculate the changes for the next planned release, release maintenance packages and larger development activities.

* Packages are cumulative which is making it easier to get a test environment to the desired state (avoiding coordination of several incremental packages)
note: and make it easy to understand which state is deployed in a given test environment.
  * A new release candidate package supersedes previous release candidates. 

![](static/img/branching-model/basicBuildPipeline-computeChanges-default-workflow.png)

:::

## Basic Build pipeline characteristics{.smaller}

* (Typically) runs on each commit added to the history of a branch
* Can produce a preliminary package that is stored in a binary artifact repository
  * Can be deployed to test environments, but not production
* May include an automated step to deploy it into the DEV-TEST environment

![](static/img/branching-model/defaultWorkflow_buildPipelineAfterMerge.png)

## Release pipeline {.smaller}


::: {layout-ncol=2}

* Produces binaries optimized for performance
  * that can be deployed to test and production environments.
* (Typically) is manually requested by the development team when a level of stability is reached
* Produces a release candidate package that can be deployed to higher test environments.
